# Introduction and Colabs

Regardless of your previous experience with neural nets, AIs can be really easy to implement. 

This guide is a set of resources, a digital bootcamp that you can use to learn about the things that we are gonna be working on. 

When I'll show you content, I'll most likely use **Google Colab**.

Code will be written in **Python3** and we will be using **conda** to make our enviroments portable to others. 

We are also gonna use **version control (git / GitHub)** to share our code between each other. 

Take a look at these notebooks to learn more about them. Basically, they allow you to run code in cells. I feel like this is a great way for me to show you code interactively and I'd highly recommend you check it out!
