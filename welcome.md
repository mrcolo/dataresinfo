Regardless of your previous experience with neural nets, AIs can be really easy to implement. Take as an example this course by Jeremy Howard, [fast.ai](http://fast.ai)

  

When I'll show you content, I'll most likely use Google Colab (Jeremy Howard uses Jupyter, same thing but local). Take a look at these notebooks to learn more about them. Basically, they allow you to run code in cells. I feel like this is a great way for me to show you code interactively and I'd highly recommend you check it out!

-  [introduction to pandas (visualizing stuff is cool!)](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/mlcc/intro_to_pandas.ipynb)

  

Hopefully at this point you got a gist of Python (for whoever wasn't fresh already).

If you have ANY question about code, you know you can message me at [fcolonnese@ucla.edu](fcolonnese@ucla.edu) at any time.
